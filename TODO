* Assembler

  - Reverse src and dest operands for two operand instructions to
    follow conventions set by assemblers for other processors.

* Building

  - Add sanity check for ncurses-devel and SDL-devel

  - Replace mpfr-2.4.0 reference with variable

  - Figure out how to save build logs (tee output?  maybe ant has a
    convenient mechanism).

* Testing

  - Figure out how to move mail task bits into external property file
    (for username, password, server, etc).

  - Import ggxamine.

* Documentation

  - Use publican to document moxie architecture.

* Benchmarks

  - I want to automake building and running on the benchmarks on a
    group of amazon ec2 instances.  I think the best way to do this is
    to package everything up in RPM format to load on the ec2
    instances.  I've already done this for MiBench data and tools, but
    now this has to happen for the tests.

    - Create binary RPMs for the benchmark suites.  Data is already
      RPMized, but need to find home for it (~3Gb).

    - Write ant magic to start ec2 instances, load and run tests,
      extract results and shutdown instances.
